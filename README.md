# BrainFuck

This is an implementation of a BrainFuck interpreter in Java. 
Its made with the intention of understanding Turing completeness and, of course, the BrainFuck language itself.

It started out with a slightly robust design, some would call it over engineered, but ended up very simple with only one class.
I plan to in the future separate the concerns (memory, parsing, executing, etc...) and make use of the Command pattern.
